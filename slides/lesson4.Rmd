## Lesson 4: Naming things

* During the process of writing code, we spend a lot of time naming things

* We name the data set we imported, the variables we recoded or created, the functions we developed, and other things

* It may feel easier while coding to name your data `dat` or `df` for data frame, a variable might easily become `var1` or, from the [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html) data set, `_RFHVDR`

* While this is an easy way to go in the moment, when you close that file and then re-open it two weeks later, you may not remember what is in `dat` or what `var1` was measuring 

* Instead of going the easy route for naming, taking the time to write names that are consistently formatted and meaningful will make your work more reproducible

## Naming things well can take extra time

![](variable-names-baby-i.jpeg){fig-alt = "Tweet screenshot that says found out my wife is due in December and I'm already sweating about what to name this kid. I have have a hard enough time deciding what to name my variables, how can I name a human? Poor little i;"}

## But it is worth it

---

## The goal when naming things 

* Ideally the names you give to variables, data frames, functions, files, and other nameable things will be meaningful to humans and easily read by machines



---

## Two parts to naming things

* There are two things to consider in naming things:

    (1) The information in the name 
    
    (1) The format of the name
    
---

## Part 1: The information in the name

* Use meaningful words
    + For example, instead of `var1` use `ageYears` to represent a variable that measures age in years
    + Some guidance suggests that **variable names should be nouns**, while **function names should be verbs**
    
* Avoid reserved words
    + There are some words in `R` (and most coding languages) that have specific meaning, these are **reserved words** and should not be used as names
    + The full list of reserved words is: `if`, `else`, `repeat`, `while`, `function`, `for`, `in`, `next`, `break`, `TRUE`, `FALSE`, `NULL`, `Inf`, `NaN`, `NA`, `NA_integer_`, `NA_real_`, `NA_complex_`, `NA_character_`, `...`

* Avoid common functions (e.g., `sum` or `mean`) and variables as much as possible 

---

## Part 2: The format of the name
    
* In addition to making a name meaningful, having a consistent format for naming data frames, variables, functions, and other things will also help you and any collaborators understand your code 

* There are many options to choose from when picking a format:
            -   `camelCase`
            -   `dot.case`
            -   `snake_case`
            -   `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
            -   `PascalCase`
            -   `kebab-case`

---

## Which format is which?

* The [tidyverse styleguide](https://style.tidyverse.org) recommends certain formats be used for certain types of objects
    + `camelCase`
    + `dot.case`
    + `snake_case`
    + `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
    + `PascalCase`
    + `kebab-case`
    
* **Variable** and **function** names should use lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores
    + `snake_case` works well

* For other types of objects, pick one of the options and use it consistently
    + For example, file names could always use `kebab-case` while lists could always use `camelCase`

---

## The naming process

* For new data frames (imported or typed in), choose a meaningful name with a format you prefer for data frames and use that

* For data imported from other sources, try using the `rename()` function that is part of the `tidyverse`

* As an example, if remembering the units for the `speed` variable from the `cars` data frame was important or would save time, try renaming it `miles_hour` 

```{r}
# open the tidyverse
library(package = "tidyverse")

# rename the speed variable using snake_case
# name the new data frame using camelCase
carsRecoded <- cars %>% 
  rename(miles_hour = speed)

# check your work
summary(carsRecoded)
```
---

## Demo

```{r echo = FALSE}
# go to unformatted-r-code.R file and change a couple of the variable names to snake_case all lower case
```

---

## Exercise

* Open the unformatted-r-code.R file and rename the rest of the variables using the suggested formatting 

* Pay attention to the case of the letters (upper or lower) and use `snake_case` to separate any parts of the variable names
