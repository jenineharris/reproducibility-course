## Lesson 2: Course logistics

In this lesson you will find more information about the skills and technology you will need to be successful in this course 

---

## Expectations and technical requirements

* The course will be taught using [R](https://cran.r-project.org) in the [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com) interactive development environment (IDE)

* If you do not have administrative access to your computer, you can still follow along by either: 
    + Installing R and R Studio to a folder [somewhere you have access to edit and save](https://rpubs.com/tomhopper/windows_nonadmin_install) things rather than to the applications or programs folder
    + Using an [R Studio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) free account  

* The course is designed for those who have some experience with R code, especially [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) 

---

## Course overview

* This course will cover coding strategies that will facilitate reproducible research including: 
    + Using space wisely 
    + Naming things in a meaningful and consistent way
    + Using function arguments 
    + Documenting the code with a prolog and annotation
    + Using seed values for random processes 
    + Writing functions for repeated tasks 
    + Integrating code and text 
    + Embedding data and R Markdown into knitted documents 
    + Keeping R packages consistent over time

## Walk through of materials 

* Several files are included for you to follow along as we create a fully reproducible document together. 

* The data file and codebook file were downloaded directly from the [Pew Internet and American Life](https://www.pewresearch.org/tools-and-resources/) and have not been edited or changed in any way

* The data and codebook are from the [Teens and Tech Survey 2018](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/dataset/teens-and-tech-survey-2018/) 

* The files are available in a ZIP file and include: 
    + An R code filed called unformatted-r-code.R 
    + A codebook file in a Word document called Pew Research Center 2019 Global Attitudes Survey WEB 
    + Data in an SPSS file called Pew Research Center Global Attitudes Spring 2019 Dataset WEB.sav
    + RProj file called participant-materials.RProj
    + Text in an unformatted text file text-for-report.rtf
