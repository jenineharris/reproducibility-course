## What is reproducibility?

* Analyses are **reproducible** when analyzing the same data with the same methods produces the same results.

* This is different from: 

     + **Repeatability**, which is the ability to conduct the same analysis on the same data (regardless of results) 
     
     + **Replicability**, which is the ability collect new data, use the same methods, and get the same results (this is the gold standard!)

## How big is the reproducibility problem?

* Researchers could only replicate [21% of 67 drug studies](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3439-c1?linkId=33568131), [40% to 60% of psychology studies](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aac4716), and [61% of economics studies](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aaf0918)

* In a sample of psychology papers, [6% of p-values were incorrectly reported](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-015-0664-2) 

* [11% of p-values](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2288-4-13) were incorrectly reported in a sample of medical papers

* [20 to 80% of papers](https://retractionwatch.com/2017/04/21/dear-journals-clean-act-regards-concerned-biostatistican/) in each of ten top scientific journals omitted or were unclear about sample sizes and up to 40% of papers in each journal did not include the type of statistical tests performed 

* Tables were mislabeled in [three of six reproduced public health studies](https://journals.lww.com/jphmp/Abstract/2019/03000/Examining_the_Reproducibility_of_6_Published.6.aspx)

## Why does it matter? 

* [Errors and omissions](https://jme.bmj.com/content/37/4/249.short) can threaten the foundation of research that practitioners and policy-makers use to make decisions

* Poor quality research can also threaten human health with over [400,000 people enrolled and over 70,000 treated](https://jme.bmj.com/content/37/11/688.short) in medical studies later retracted

* Retracted research [continues to be cited](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/209653) after retraction, influencing additional science

## How can I make my research reproducible? 

* Two things are needed to reproduce research:

    + Access to the data 

    + The statistical code or very detailed methods instructions

## How can R Markdown help? 

* R Markdown is one of several tools for literate programming 

* Literate programming integrates text with code and results in a single document

---

## What features of R Markdown facilitate reproducibility?

* Integration of code and text and results

* Automated references

* Some output formats can also embed the data

* Highly flexible output formatting (e.g., html, Word, pdf)
