## Lesson 10: Embedding files to improve reproducibility

* To reproduce analyses, the data and the code (or very detailed instructions for analysis) are the necessary components

* One way to include everything needed for reproducing analyses is embedding the data, code, and instructions in Quarto html rendered files

    + The `xfun` package is used to embed files

---

## Using the `xfun` package

* The `xfun` package can be used to attach a single file, multiple files, or a directory in a knit html document

* When multiple files are attached, they are compressed into a zip file, which is embedded

* The file, files, or directory is available by clicking on a link in the knit html file

## Demo of the `xfun` package

```{r echo = FALSE}
# demo the xfun package and .Rproj on the Quarto file
# suggest to the audience they could follow along
```
